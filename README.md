El-Nino is the warm phase of El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), it is an irregular ocean and climate pattern that occurs every 3 to 7 years and lasts for about 9 to 12 months. El-Nino occurs in the Equatorial Pacific region and has global impacts on weather patterns. Analyzing El Niño data and predicting its occurrence can help in understanding and preparing for its effects. In this report, we will analyze El-Niño data using machine learning models for predicting weather patterns.
